# COVID-19_Prediction_ML
This project is to predict whether a person has COVID-19 or not, using machine learning techniques. The prediction is performed using the symptoms of the patients.

We have used 4 different techniques to predict COVID-19 based on patient's symptoms. Which are

1. Logistic Regression
2. Naive Bayes
3. Support Vector Machine
4. Random Forest
